# Home for Hackers and Developers

##### This repository contains open-source releases from Mission College's Silicon Society Hackers and it's affiliates.

##### "Build The Bastion!" is a flexible hackathon framework designed for busy student-professionals to bolster their portfolio skills at their own pace. The curriculum contains exercises that will teach students the essential technologies needed to be an elite hacker or developer. 

##### Once contributors prove their mettle, bounties are available to accomplish in exchange for equity of the entity that is "The Bastion". Many of these bounties are jobs needed to deploy a new startup company's infrastructure. The purpose of this experience is to provide students an opportunity to get a simulation of real-life experience and the possibility of building a profitable talent agency.
